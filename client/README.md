Reviewz
-----------
A simple CRUD application that allows users to write reviews of their favorite "thing".
The client will have the ability to write, edit and delete reviews. The data will be stored and/or retrieved from a local server.
The site will also populate random reviews from within the database that the use should be unable to edit or delete. 
The user should be able to leave a thumbs up or thumbs down on all reviews on the site.

Technologies: Javascript, React, Node.js, MySQL, Express, HTML, CSS

Problems:
Seem to have issues connecting to local server. Could be due to changes in root access.
